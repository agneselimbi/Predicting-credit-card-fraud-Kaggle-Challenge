2. **Credit Card Default**: with this project, I want to detect fraudulent transactions from a series of transactions that occur between Jan - Apr 2022. I explore a number of machine learning techniques for my predictions. Initially,  I tried artiificially augmenting the fruadulent transactions using the SMOTE technique. However,  we see the techniques perform better without augmentation of the dataset. the Due to the imbalance in the dataset, precision is used as our metric of interest rather than accuracy.The dataset is provided by Kaggle for th e

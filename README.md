# Predict credit card fraud
 With this project, I want to detect fraudulent transactions from a series of transactions that occur between Jan - Apr 2022 using Tree Ensemble Methods(Decision Tree,Random Forest and Xgboost). 
 1. Exploratory data analysis:
 - Artificially augmented the fraudulent transactions using the SMOTE technique.
 - 
2. Models:
   Main evaluation metric retained was precision due to imbalanced dataset
   - Decision Tree:
   - Random Forest:
   - XGboost:
